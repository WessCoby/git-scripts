## Git Scripts
Scripts to simplify using Git

### Overview
This may seem like taking time to do a lot of work that "aliases" could have easily handled, but no! This is way more. 
Some of these scripts have been programmed to combine a series of tasks into a single command, and/or handle edge cases; the `commit` script, for instance, takes care of staging selected files first before committing; `rl` (repolink) also handles the process of adding a remote link to the newly created repo, and making the first push to the remote repo. <br> More info on them in the Scripts section.
